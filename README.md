# ESPN Team Calendar & Home Assitant

Although there is the ability to do with just google calendars, one of things I was not happy with was that it only showed team names. Since I follow college football & basketball I wanted to know the school my team (Michigan Wolverines) was playing against. I discovered by accident really that this was possible courtesy of ESPN and ROTK calendars. 

The thing I like about the calendar is that the data in the message gives a lot more information about the event. With this information I have been able to tell weather the game is a home or away, the name of the school, start time, and what channel the broadcast is on. 

Lets get started. 

To do this we go to ESPN.com, and on the sport tab click the sport you wish to follow. For this example I am using Collage Football (NCAAF).

From this page you can go to the Teams tab which displays all the teams. Alternately, you can filter by conference as well. 

For this example I am using Big Ten and University of Michigan

Once on the page for your team, select schedule and they'll be a button to that says "Add to Calendar".

Follow the on-screen prompts as follows to add the calendar to google.

Here you can enter your TV information for game channel.

Next, select the calendar you add the schedule too. In our case we will use Google Calendar.

Once selected, another pop up will appear asking permission for ROTK Calendar access to your google account. 

After authorization has completed, the calendar will now show up in your Google Calendar.
