# ESPN Team Calendar & Home Assitant

Although there is the ability to do with just google calendars, one of things I was not happy with was that it only showed team names. Since I follow college football & basketball I wanted to know the school my team (Michigan Wolverines) was playing against. I discovered by accident really that this was possible courtesy of ESPN and ROTK calendars. 

The thing I like about the calendar is that the data in the message gives a lot more information about the event. With this information I have been able to tell weather the game is a home or away, the name of the school, start time, and what channel the broadcast is on. 

Please see the wiki to get started.
